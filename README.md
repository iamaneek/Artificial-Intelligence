Analysis of Association Rule Mining Algorithms for Market Basket Analysis

Abstract: Association rule mining is a widely researched field due to
its importance in real life applications. This concept is the epicenter of
market basket analysis - finding the frequent item-set bought a customer
in one visit. The focus in this work is on comparing 3 popular associa-
tion rule mining algorithms widely used for market basked analysis. The
first major algorithm proposed was the Apriori Algorithm, which was a
significant breakthrough in the Data Mining field. Using the concepts of
this algorithm, multiple other algorithms have been proposed and imple-
ment. The second algorithm discussed in this paper is FP-Growth and
the third algorithm is the SIMILIS algorithm. A comprehensive survey
of these 3 algorithms has been carried out and their similarities and
differences have been analytically discussed.
